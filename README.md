## listcopy

A utility written in Python 3 for copying files listed in text documents to a given directory. Useful for collecting files scattered over multiple directories into one place after compiling their locations in a list, especially when the files have no pattern to filter against (for instance with find or other tools).

### Tip
Sublime Text and Atom will paste the full path of any files you copy to the
clipboard, allowing easy construction of source files for use with this script.
